Converts Swagger docs to NGINX Configs
=======================

This project converts swagger documentation to NGINX configuration files.

This project does not aim to cover all use cases but rather aid development
of API Gateways through use of NGINX. The idea is to allow for adoption of 
NGINX as an API Gateway that is more aware of the API, enabling it to play
gatekeeper on requests through use of a common definition.

This is the README file for the project.

The file should use UTF-8 encoding and be written using `reStructuredText
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_. It
will be used to generate the project webpage on PyPI and will be displayed as
the project homepage on common code-hosting services, and should be written for
that purpose.

Typical contents for this file would include an overview of the project, basic
usage examples, etc. Generally, including the project changelog in here is not
a good idea, although a simple "What's New" section for the most recent version
may be appropriate.
