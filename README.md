# nginx-swag
Converts Swagger to NGINX configurations

## Overview
This project converts swagger documentation to NGINX configuration files.

This project does not aim to cover all use cases but rather aid development
of API Gateways through use of NGINX. The idea is to allow for adoption of
NGINX as an API Gateway that is more aware of the API, enabling it to play
gatekeeper on requests through use of a common definition.
